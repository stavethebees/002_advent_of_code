# Advent of code solutions

Puzzles here: https://adventofcode.com/2020

Python solutions are in the python folder, split into folders by day.
Solutions in Houdini's VEX are available in the vex folder (named as .h files so it would have C style syntax highlighting) but I stopped doing solutions after 7 days.
